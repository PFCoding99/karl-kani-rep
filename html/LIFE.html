    <h2>LIFE COLLECTION</h2>
    <p>
      Introducing the Karl Kani Fall ‘22 collection, a tribute to the original
      Brooklyn, NY aesthetics still driving the future of streetwear. Signature
      styles from the 90’s are reimagined and accompanied by expertly crafted
      wardrobe staples and statement pieces. Butter-soft lambskins and ring-spun
      vintage washed cottons are complemented by a versatile neutral palette and
      finished with luxurious leather, rubber or embroidered logo detailing on
      each design.
